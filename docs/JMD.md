# Judgment Minimal Definition (JMD)

This document defines the minimal, non-negotiable condition under which
an event qualifies as a judgment in AJT.

This definition is normative, not illustrative.
If an event does not satisfy JMD, it is not a judgment by definition.

---

## Definition

An event is a judgment if and only if all three conditions are satisfied:

1. Multiple outcome paths existed (≥ 2)
2. At least one non-selected path was explicitly evaluated
3. The selected outcome is recorded as a choice among those paths

---

## Interpretation Rules

- Recording an outcome alone does NOT constitute a judgment.
- Automatic rule application without evaluated alternatives is NOT a judgment.
- JMD does NOT evaluate correctness, rationality, or intent.
- JMD proves the existence of choice, not the quality of reasoning.

---

## Canonical Statement

AJT records not outcomes, but the existence of choice.
