# OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention Draft

This directory contains a draft proposal for an OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention for AI Judgment Trail events.

**Status:** Experimental proposal

## Important Notes

- This is **NOT** an official OpenTelemetry specification
- It exists to gather early feedback and real-world usage before submitting a PR
- The schema remains compatible with AJT v0.1 core fields

## Purpose

AI Judgment Trail (AJT) logs structured decisions made by AI systems. This draft proposes mapping AJT fields to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions to enable:

- Unified observability for AI decisions
- Integration with existing OTel pipelines
- Vendor-neutral accountability trails

## Next Steps

1. Gather real-world usage feedback
2. Validate field naming alignment with OTel conventions
3. Submit formal proposal to OpenTelemetry semantic-conventions repository

## Feedback

Open an issue in this repository to discuss the OTel mapping proposal.
